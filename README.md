This is a Basic Temperature Calculator that calculates Kelvin, Celsius and Fahrenheit temperatures from one to another.

It rounds up all numbers, For example: 27.85 gets rounded up to 28
If you really don't want that, just remove Math.ceil() in the JS code

GOTHICB is just a font I like, u can remove that too
